Potential Commands:
- Scoring the gear in autonomous
- Scoring the balls in autonomous at the ball bin
- Scoring the balls in autonomous at the boiler
- Scoring the balls in general
- Feeding the balls into the shooter
- Moving to the boiler in autonomous
- Moving to the ball bin in autonomous
- Triggering the ball bin in autonomous
- Starting or stopping the ball intake

Potential Features:
- While driving, turn on/off the intake(s) based on which direction we are driving (or off if we are not driving)
- While driving, turn on/off the feeder based if we are driving?
- Should we sense if balls are (or have been recently) in the intakes?
- Averaging the camera samples
- Sensing the rope is in the climber
- Sensing the rope is acquired by a non-climber guiding mechanism
- Moving the rope with a non-climber guiding mechanism
- Agitating the balls in the hopper
- Feedback that the hopper is mostly full
