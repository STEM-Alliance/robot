Potential Commands:
- Scoring the gear in autonomous
- Scoring the balls in autonomous at the ball bin
- Scoring the balls in autonomous at the boiler
- Scoring the balls in general
- Feeding the balls into the shooter
- Moving to the boiler in autonomous
- Moving to the ball bin in autonomous
- Triggering the ball bin in autonomous

Camera Potential Features:
- Averaging the camera samples

Climber Potential Features:
- Sensing the rope is in the climber
- Sensing the rope is acquired by a non-climber guiding mechanism
- Moving the rope with a non-climber guiding mechanism

Feeder potential features:
- Move the ball as far in as possible, then stop based on a sensor
- Pause loading the feeder to let RPMs get back into range

Intake Potential Features:
- While driving, turn on/off the intake(s) based on which direction we are driving (or off if we are not driving)
- While driving, turn on/off the feeder based if we are driving?
- Should we sense if balls are (or have been recently) in the intakes?

Hopper Potential Features:
- Agitating the balls in the hopper
- Feedback that the hopper is mostly full

Shooter Potential Features:
- Rev Shooter automatically when we know we might be interested in shooting, such as for the next 10 seconds if we just scored a gear
